This repository will serve as a collection of my homework assignments from the class CSC 3100, Web Development, at Tennessee Technological University.

Assignment one is an excersize to get used to using bootstrap and teach the basics of html. The Registration Form folder contains all of the relevant files and code for this assignment.
I have included comments in the code detailing what certain parts of the code do.
