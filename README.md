This repository will serve as a collection of my homework assignments from the class CSC 3100, Web Development, at Tennessee Technological University.

Assignment one is an excersize to get used to using bootstrap and teach the basics of html. The Registration Form folder contains all of the relevant files and code for this assignment. This page is purely for practice and serves no purpose other than asthetics.
I have included comments in the code detailing what certain parts of the code do.

Added functionality has been added to the registration form. Input validation was added for most inout fields, as well as sweet alerts for when there are errors. I implemented responsive alerts for when there are many errors, as opposed to only a few. Further funtionality will be added in future updates as the form evolves.

Added a login page that loads before the registration page, along with a button to navigate to the registration page if an account needs to be created. I also added input validation for the login page, as well as a button I plan to implement into the registration page allowing the user to view their typed password, changing the type of the input between text and password. Need to implement comments, but will in next commit.

Added second "view password" button to the registration page, as well as added more regular expressions. Alongside the email regex that was already present, I added one for US postal codes, as well as one for phone numbers. I also fully commented the code so mostly everything, and its function, is labeled.
